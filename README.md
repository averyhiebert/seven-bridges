# The Bridges of Königsberg

A little puzzle/text-adventure game based on the classic "Seven Bridges of Königsberg" puzzle.  The game is beatable, I promise! Play it [here](https://averyhiebert.github.io/seven-bridges/).

To be honest, the game is not great (the adventure elements and the mathematical puzzle don't play well together), although it is beatable.  I'm mostly only making this public as a reference for myself (and others?) for an easy way to implement in-line choice links in Ink (see lines 110 - 127 and 140-166 of `docs/main.js`).

Sorry for putting the web page itself in `docs`.  I just find that this is the easiest/laziest way to deploy to github pages.
