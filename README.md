# The Bridges of Königsberg

A little puzzle/text-adventure game based on the classic "Seven Bridges of Königsberg" puzzle.  The game is beatable, I promise! Play it [here]().

To be honest, the game is not great (the adventure elements and the mathematical puzzle don't play well together), although it is beatable.  I'm mostly only making this public as a reference for myself (and others?) for an easy way to implement in-line choice links in Ink.
